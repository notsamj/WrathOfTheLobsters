        Note:
        I was aware of this method: seed = (seed * constant1 + constant2) % constant3, randomFloat = seed / constant3 from a function
        used in an example in one of my classes back in University. I did not come up with this formula for generating "random" numbers. I imagine
        it can be found somewhere online but I wanted to make my generation method as unique as I could while still making it manageable so didn't do
        any research other than consulting my memory. I did come up with the three constants by randomly typing numbers and testing the distribution.
